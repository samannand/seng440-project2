## Requirements to run application

- Crapchat was developed using Android API Level 28 (Pie)
- All testing was only able to be performed on an emulator, as opposed to a physical device
- The emulator used was a Pixel 3 running API 28, with a front facing emulated camera, and a rear facing 'virtual scene' camera
- A Google Maps API key must be provided in order to run the application. Please see the example xml file in this repo and add your own key. This file needs to be added to the res/values folder of the Android project.
